/*
There are times when your answer is a floating point that contains the undesired amount of digits after the decimal. Here, we'll learn how to get a precise answer out of a floating number. You are given two floating numbers a and b. You need to output a/b and decimal precision of a/b up to 3 places after the decimal point.
Note: You may use System.out.format()

        float result = a/b;
        
        
        // Your code here to print upto 3 decimal places
        System.out.print(result + " ");
        System.out.format("%.3f", result);
